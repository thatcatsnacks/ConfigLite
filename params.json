{"name":"ConfigLite","tagline":"A very lightweight/minimalist config file manager","body":"### ConfigLite: A fast, lightweight configuration management system\r\nConfigLite is a lightweight and minimalist configuration file (config) management system. ConfigLite is exceptionally effective at handling files that contain up to 60 settings. With an easy-to-use config syntax, and an intuitive interface for config file management, ConfigLite is perfect for projects using smaller configs.\r\n\r\n### ConfigLite Configuration File Syntax\r\nA ConfigLite config is made up of two entities: _Elements_ and _Settings_. An _element_ is the highest-level entity, and is enclosed in braces('[' and ']'). An _element_ name may only contain alphanumeric characters, and must be all-caps. An _element_ is the parent object of the second entity, a _setting_. A _setting_ is made up of two parts: the attribute and the value. An attribute may only contain alphanumeric characters. A value can be represented as any of Java's common data types(String, int, short, byte, boolean, char). A _setting_ must enclose strings in double-quotes, characters in single-quotes, and all other datatypes without quotes. Finally, a _setting_ must end with a semicolon. A config file will look similar to:\r\n```\r\n[ELEMENT_NAME]\r\nattribute1=\"value1\";\r\nattribute2=2;\r\nattribute3=true;\r\nattribute4='c';\r\n```\r\n### ConfigLite Sample Use\r\nThe ConfigLite API makes it incredibly easy to manage an existing config file, or to create a new one. To demonstrate the ease of ConfigLite, here are some sample tasks:\r\n\r\nTo add an element:\r\n```\r\nConfigLite config = new ConfigLite();\r\nconfig.addElement(\"ELEMENT_NAME\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add a setting to an element:\r\n```\r\nconfig.addSetting(\"ELEMENT_NAME\", \"attribute_name\", \"value\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add multiple settings to an element:\r\n```\r\n//Note: you can use the above method to enter multiples\r\nconfig.enterElement(\"ELEMENT_NAME\");\r\nconfig.addSetting(\"attribute_name\", \"value\");\r\nconfig.addSetting(\"attribute_name2\", 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCat Snacks is the pseudonym of a Star Wars loving Computer Science student.
